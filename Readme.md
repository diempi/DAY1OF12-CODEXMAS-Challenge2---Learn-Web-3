# 🎄 Diempi DAY 2 OF 12 CODEXMAS Challenge 2 - Learn Web 3 🎄

## 🌟 Project Description
Welcome to the festive coding challenge! In this challenge, we're diving into the world of Web3 with a holiday twist. 🎅🏼🚀

**Write a Christmas smart contract that has a function that accepts a string as an input, adds, "Merry Christmas" and returns the whole string. Think of this as combining both of the strings into one.**

This project is all about spreading holiday cheer while exploring the exciting realm of blockchain and smart contracts. 🌍💻

## 🛠️ How It Works
Our smart contract is written in Solidity and is designed to add a special Christmas greeting to any string input. Here's a quick overview:

- **Functionality**: The contract includes a function `addChristmasGreeting` that takes a string input, concatenates "Merry Christmas" to it, and returns the new festive message.
- **Tech Stack**: Ethereum, Solidity

## 📋 Requirements
To interact with this contract, you'll need:
- An Ethereum wallet (like MetaMask)
- Some Ether (for deploying/testing on a testnet)
- A Solidity development environment (like Remix IDE)

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**: `https://github.com/diempi/DAY1OF12-CODEXMAS-Challenge2---Learn-Web-3`
2. **Navigate to the Project**: `cd your-project-folder`
3. **Install Dependencies** (if any)
4. **Deploy the Contract** on a testnet using Remix IDE or your preferred Solidity environment.

## 📝 Usage
- Open your Solidity environment.
- Deploy the contract.
- Call the `addChristmasGreeting` function with a string of your choice.
- Enjoy the festive response!

## 🎉 Happy Coding & Happy Holidays! 🎉
